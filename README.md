  * foundational stuff.  
  * What is an LLM?  How do these things work?  Are they safe?  
  * we'll look at the RAG pattern and agentic AI and what that means
  * we'll briefly touch on "copilot"
* 4/16 630-830  virtual only
  * might be worth talking through how to find good use cases, how to structure a team and project, pick tools, how the real world does Responsible AI etc
  * we'll also take a look at Natural Language to SQL (nl2sql) and the pros and cons of doing this
* 4/23 630-830  virtual only
  * advanced topics around "querying databases"
    * [nl2sql in Fabric](fabric.md)
    * TAG and LOTUS

    * Advanced use cases
    * GraphRAG (RAG against a Knowledge Graph)
  * bring your use cases and questions and let's discuss them
  * let's get ready for actually building something using an LLM.  Let's get an environment setup and ready.  
* 4/30 630-830 virtual onliy 
  * let's build something and test the waters.  this might be complicated if folks don't have access to azure subscriptions and whatnot.  I might have a good solution to this problem by then.  Otherwise, another possible topic would be Fabric and the AI skills that exist there (altho they are half-baked).
